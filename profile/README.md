## Hi there 👋

LivePublication 📄 is an effort to integrate our computational workflows with natural language documents - thus enabling live, dynamic representations of our scientific research. This is an active exploration of integrations between workflow platforms, data representations, and natural language document formats and is at high risk of change!

### Primary repositories/ingredients for a LivePublication:

| Repo                                                                                                    | Purpose                                                                   |

| [Globus-gladier prospective provenance workspace](https://github.com/LivePublication/gladier-globus-orchestration/tree/main) | A simple gladier example for generating the Workflow Execution Plan - which is then embedded as prospective provenance within a ProvenanceRun crate |
